# Export-Cleanup
Using AppScripts on a Google Sheet, ExportCleanup converts Google Classroom's 'Export all Grades into Sheets' into a CSV formatted so Q can import.<br>
<br>
After "Exporting all grades to sheets," c/p the contents into this sheet > entire array into the Sheet > Export Cleanup > CleanUp!<br>
File > download > comma separated value file (.csv) <br>
Upload the csv into Q. <br><br><br>
## Room for Improvement<br>
-Can we rig a button do download all correctly formatted sheets as csv in one push?<br>
-Can we make it more user friendly...no so "hackery"?
